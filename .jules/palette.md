## 2025-05-15 - Accessibility in Auth Forms
**Learning:** Auth pages (Login/Signup) often have custom layouts that bypass standard UI components, leading to missing accessibility attributes like `aria-label` on icon-only toggles and disconnected form labels.
**Action:** Always verify `aria-label` on password visibility and theme toggles in custom form implementations. Ensure all form labels use `htmlFor` to link to input `id`s.
