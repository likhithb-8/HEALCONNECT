## 2025-05-15 - Avoiding Interval Churn in Real-time Components
**Learning:** In React components that use `setInterval` for high-frequency updates (like ECG monitors), including state or props in the `useEffect` dependency array causes the interval to be cleared and recreated on every update. This leads to "interval churn" and inconsistent timing.
**Action:** Use `useRef` to track fast-changing external data and functional updates (`setECGData(prev => ...)`) to keep the effect dependency array empty, ensuring a single stable interval for the component's lifecycle.

## 2025-05-15 - Memoizing Real-time Analysis Components
**Learning:** Components that perform O(n) array operations (like filtering history) or multiple status checks on every render can significantly impact performance when embedded in live monitoring views that "tick" every 2-3 seconds.
**Action:** Use `useMemo` to wrap expensive analysis logic in real-time dashboards, ensuring they only re-compute when the underlying data (current vitals or history) actually changes.

## 2025-05-15 - Derived State vs Effect-based State for Vitals
**Learning:** Using 'useState' and 'useEffect' to calculate health alerts based on rapidly updating vitals (every 2-3 seconds) causes a secondary render cycle on every update.
**Action:** Prefer 'useMemo' to derive alert status directly from vitals during the initial render phase, reducing render overhead by 50% in real-time monitoring views.
