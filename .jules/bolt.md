## 2025-05-15 - Avoiding Interval Churn in Real-time Components
**Learning:** In React components that use `setInterval` for high-frequency updates (like ECG monitors), including state or props in the `useEffect` dependency array causes the interval to be cleared and recreated on every update. This leads to "interval churn" and inconsistent timing.
**Action:** Use `useRef` to track fast-changing external data and functional updates (`setECGData(prev => ...)`) to keep the effect dependency array empty, ensuring a single stable interval for the component's lifecycle.
